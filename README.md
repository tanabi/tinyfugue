TF-4 with SSL Support Back-Ported In

# WHAT?
This is tf 4.0s1 by Ken Keys ("Hawkeye").  It's not the latest and greatest.
If you want that, go here.   http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/

Or to the many other GITHUB's out there that continue Ken's work.

If you don't know what tf is, you don't belong here :D

# WHY?
Because I really don't like the TF version 5 series.  Massive changes
were made to the screen handling code, and it seems like TF 5 was built
with the assumption that you'd be using visual mode.

Well, I hate visual mode.  I've been doing the tf-4 way of things for
damn near 20 years, and I like being able to hit enter a bunch of
times to space out incoming text and to keep track of where I'm at.

With tf 5, you can do that, but if you switch from one world to the
other, it resets all your extra spacing ... and it basically ruins
my whole flow.

Anyway, whatever - the long and short is, I like tf 4, don't like tf 5,
but wanted to back-port in tf 5's SSL support so I could have that.

100% of this code is the original author's (see CREDITS), I merely
copy and pasted code from tf 5 into tf 4 and massaged it to work.

This will probably only build on Linux, no effort was made to make
it cross platform.  Though it should build on Windows with a handful
of tweaks.  I don't use it on Windows so I didn't try :)

This is on GITHUB to pay it forward, in case someone else is a
kanktankerous coot who wants this as well.

Thanks, Ken, wherever you are -- love your work. :)
