       _T_i_n_y_F_u_g_u_e  (also known as "Fugue" or "TF") is a line-based
       client designed for connecting to MUD servers  (note:  LP,
       DIKU,  and  other  servers  which use prompts require "/lp
       on"; see /help prompts).

       Most of the _T_F documentation is in the  help  file,  which
       may  be read online with the "/help" command.  This manual
       page may be obsolete in certain areas; however, the  help-
       file will always be up to date.

       _T_i_n_y_F_u_g_u_e  is  larger  than most MUD clients, but has many
       more features and is much more flexible.  The goal  is  to
       provide  the  most  functionality  in  a client that still
       maintains the user-friendliness of _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k.  Clients with
       extension  languages  such  as _T_c_l_t_t or _V_a_p_o_r_T_a_l_k can do a
       little more in certain areas, but are considerably  harder
       to  use and learn.  _T_F provides most of these abilities in
       such a manner that learning to use  any  one  function  is
       relatively easy.

       Because  I am continually adding new features and changing
       the code, _T_F  sometimes  becomes  less  stable  in  a  new
       release.   Versions  labled  "alpha"  are generally not as
       well tested as "beta" versions, so they have the potential
       for  more  bugs.  For this reason, I leave some older ver-
       sions at the ftp site where I distribute _T_F (ftp.tcp.com),
       which  do  not  have all the current features but may have
       fewer bugs than the most recent release.

       With no arguments, _T_F will try to  connect  to  the  first
       world defined in the configuration file(s).

       With a wwoorrlldd argument, _T_F will try to connect to wwoorrlldd, as
       defined in the configuration file.  If wwoorrlldd  is  omitted,
       it  will try to connect to the first world defined in your
       configuration files.

       With hhoosstt and ppoorrtt arguments, _T_F will define  a  temporary
       world  and  try  to  connect to it.  The hhoosstt may be an IP
       number or regular name format.

       OPTIONS

       -f_f_i_l_e Load _f_i_l_e instead of $HOME/.tfrc at startup.

       Among other things, _T_F allows you to:

       Divide  the  screen  into two parts, for input and output,
       with flexible handling of input (/visual mode).

       Connect to multiple worlds and switch between them.

       Wrap MUD output at the edge of the screen.

       Edit text in the input buffer.

       Recall previous commands.

       Modify key sequences used to perform editing functions.

       Bind commands to key sequences.

       Define complex macros to perform MUD tasks easily.

       Create triggers which automatically perform certain  tasks
       when certain output is received from the MUD.

       Modify  existing  macros  using either a command format or
       interactive editing.

       Support "portals" that automatically switch from world  to
       world.

       Hilite  or color all or part of a line that matches a cer-
       tain pattern.

       Gag lines that match certain patterns.

       Suppress frequently repeated text ("spamming").

       Automatically log into a character on a world.

       Send a text file to the MUD in flexible ways, or  echo  it
       locally.

       Send the output of a system command to the MUD, or echo it
       locally.

       Send text previously received from the MUD to the MUD,  or
       echo it locally.

       Repeat a MUD or _T_F command a number of times.

       Do  the  above  four  things at varying intervals, or at a
       rapid-fire rate.

       Log a session to a file.

       _T_F will attempt to read  two  files  when  starting.   The
       first  is a public configuration file "stdlib.tf", located
       in TFLIBDIR.  TFLIBDIR is defined when  _T_F  is  installed,
       and  is  often  /usr/local/lib/tf.lib,  or  under the home
       directory of the installer.  This  library  contains  many
       macros  and definitions essential to the correct operation
       of _T_F_.

       Next, _T_F will attempt to read your personal  configuration
       file,  $HOME/.tfrc,  in  which you can put any _T_F commands
       you want executed automatically at startup.   Two  of  the
       most useful commands to use in a _T_F configuration file are
       /addworld and /load.

       For backward compatability, _T_F will also try to  read  the
       _T_i_n_y_T_a_l_k   configuration   file.   Its  name  defautls  to
       $HOME/.tinytalk, or can be defined by the  TINYTALK  envi-
       ronment  variable.   This  file  may  start with a list of
       worlds that will be defined as if with /addworld.


HHIISSTTOORRYY
       Anton  Rang  (Tarrant)  in  February  of   1990   released
       _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k,  the  first  Tinyclient with any great number of
       features, including hiliting and suppression of text, sim-
       ple  triggers,  and  separating  input  and  output on the
       screen.  Leo Plotkin (Grod) made rather extensive  modifi-
       cations  to _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k to produce _T_i_n_y_w_a_r_, which was plagued
       with some serious bugs and was never  officially  released
       (the  phrase "Tinywar doesn't exist" is often quoted), and
       is now an unsupported client.  _T_F began when  Greg  Hudson
       (Explorer_Bob)  merged many of the new features of _T_i_n_y_w_a_r
       back into _T_i_n_y_T_a_l_k_, and added many  new  features  of  his
       own,  most  notably the split screen.  Some of the code in
       Greg's releases was contributed  by  Leo  Plotkin.   After
       Greg  moved  on to _V_a_p_o_r_T_a_l_k_, Ken Keys (Hawkeye) took over

       design and maintenance of _T_F in July 1991,  and  continues
       to make improvements in features and performance.

       The  code  size of _T_F has surpassed 300K (unstripped), and
       is signifigantly larger than _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k_.  It  is,  in  fact,
       more  than  three  times  the size of a number of existing
       servers.  As of version 3.0, it has  66  builtin  commands
       and  57 library commands, each documented in the helpfile.

       It has been stated that _T_F is the most-used client in MUD-
       dom  at  the  current time.  I haven't taken a poll, but I
       wouldn't be surprised.

       _T_F has significantly changed the tinyclient world.  It has
       a  number  of  merits  and a number of flaws, and has fre-
       quently been criticized (mostly  out  of  boredom;  nobody
       takes this business too seriously) as having too many fea-
       tures and being too damn big.

            "Tinywar doesn't exist; TinyFugue merely  shouldn't."
       -- Coined by Woodlock, I believe.

            "TinyFugue  is  a work of art."  -- Binder, obviously
       after having too much to drink.

            "TinyFugue is the biggest hack since the platform  it
       was  built  on."   --  Explorer_Bob,  in  one of his lucid
       moments.

       The New York Times, the Christian Science Monitor and  the
       Washington Post all refused to comment.

       VERSION 3.2

       /rand has been replaced with rand().  Color names  can  no
       longer  be  user defined (but color codes still can).  The
       "=" operator does comparison, not assignment.

       VERSION 3.1

       Added type argument to WORLD and LOGIN hooks.

       VERSION 3.0

       Backslashes in macros are interpreted slightly differently
       than  in  previous  versions.   Turning on the "backslash"
       flag will enable the old behavior.

       VERSION 2.1

       The CONNECT hook is now called before the LOGIN hook.   In
       2.0, CONNECT was called after autologin.

       VERSION 2.0

       In  versions  prior to 2.0, <space> was used to scroll the
       pager; 2.0 uses <tab> as the default, to allow  the  pager
       to be nonblocking.

       _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k  style  name  gags and hilites are no longer sup-
       ported.  You must use the '*' wildcard explicitly,  as  in
       '/hilite hawkeye*'.

       _T_i_n_y_t_a_l_k style page and whisper hilites are no longer sup-
       ported.  However, /hilite_page and /hilite_whisper  macros
       are provided in the default macro library.

       The .tinytalk file may not be supported in the future; use
       .tfrc instead.

       The '-' command line option in versions prior to 2.0 is no
       longer supported, and has been replaced with '-l'.

       When unterbamfing, the old connection should not be closed
       until the new connection succeeds.

       If a shell quote (/quote !) reads a partial line from  the

       read.
