The differences section only applies to things that need to be changed
or are not implemented in TinyFugue.  Tf offers a lot more functionality
in many areas than the clients below, of course.

-------------
Differences from TinyTalk (Tarrant's client)
-------------
Compatibility is almost complete.  All .tinytalk files should work
with Fugue.  The /tinytalk flag (defaults to on) makes the necessary
changes to convert between tinytalk command formats to tinyfugue
command formats.

-------------
Differences from TinyWar (Grod's client)
-------------
Use /sub on to substitute %; and %\ for newlines in regular text
%n works only in macros and triggers, and in /sub full mode
/crypt and /random removed
"%2*" argument sub should be replaced by "%-1"
